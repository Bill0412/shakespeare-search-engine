# Shakespeare Search Engine

Note: this is a simple search engine that crawls the webpage http://shakespeare.mit.edu/,
indexes the pages and provides a web interface for searching.

## deployment
This search engine is deployed at http://shakespeare.fenghe.us/, and the more detailed tutorial is at https://fenghe.us/try-out-my-tiny-search-engine-from-start/.

## How to test the code
There are many dependencies that may not be easy to install for novices to python, so it is 
recommended that you use the same IDE(PyCharm, which is free for students) and configure the
environment graphically.

## LICENCE
